# Abstract

This chapter introduces Conjunctive Analysis of Case Configurations (CACC) for the study of crime and place. After introducing CACC as an alternative approach to variable-oriented thinking, we present its conceptual underpinnings and limitations. We then provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to conduct a CACC, accompanied by an example using public data and R code. The chapter contains many references to other publications that developed the CACC method and applied it to different crime contexts.
