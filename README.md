# Welcome to my website!
This is the repository of my academic website hosted on GitHub Pages. The website serves as a platform to share my publications in *open access*.

## Structure
- [Home](#home)
- [Publications](#publications)
- [About me](#about-me)

## Home
The home page of my website. From here you can access to the rest of the sections of the web and to my CV.

## Publications
This section compiles in chronological order my peer-reviewed publications, either journal articles or book chapters. Each publication has a dedicated page that contains metadata and allows access to the manuscript in open access. When appropriate it also provides links to related materials, such as data and analytic code. A list of keywords in the right-hand menu also allows access to publications by category.

## About Me
A self-explanatory section with some information about me.
