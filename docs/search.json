My name is Asier Moneva and I am a postdoc at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and\r\nLaw Enforcement (NSCR) and also at the Center\r\nof Expertise Cyber Security at The Hague University of Applied\r\nSciences. (Yes, I have two affiliations.) Asier is a Spanish\r\nname—Basque, actually—that sounds like ah-see-AIR, with a hard\r\n‘R’ at the end. But don’t worry, I won’t be mad if you don’t pronounce\r\nit right… the first time!\r\nMy background is in Criminology, which means I am a social scientist.\r\nIn particular, I research how, when, and\r\nwhere cybercrime occur, focusing on the human factors\r\ninvolved. To do so, I rely mainly on quantitative methods and data\r\nscience, and I enjoy collaborating with researchers from other\r\ndisciplines as well as with practitioners and professionals. The purpose\r\nof my research is twofold: to generate knowledge to better understand\r\ncybercrime, and to find solutions to reduce it or mitigate its\r\nimpact.\r\nI am committed to open science; that’s why I built this website: to\r\nprovide a portal to access my research without barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
