My name is Asier Moneva and I am a postdoc at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR) and also at the Center of Expertise Cyber Security at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. (Yes, I have two affiliations.) Asier is a Spanish name—Basque, actually—that sounds like ah-see-AIR, with a hard ‘R’ at the end. But don’t worry, I won’t be mad if you don’t pronounce it right… the first time!\r\n              My background is in Criminology, which means I am a social scientist. In particular, I research how, when, and where cybercrime occur, focusing on the human factors involved. To do so, I rely mainly on quantitative methods and data science, and I enjoy collaborating with researchers from other disciplines as well as with practitioners and professionals. The purpose of my research is twofold: to generate knowledge to better understand cybercrime, and to find solutions to reduce it or mitigate its impact.\r\n              I am committed to open science; that’s why I built this website: to provide a portal to access my research without barriers.\r\n              You can click the button below to access my curriculum vitae.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Hi!

      "description": "On this website you can find my publications in open access. Just click on ['Publications'](publications.html) in the navigation bar for an overview or use the search function if you are looking for something specific. There is an individual post for each publication. At the bottom of each post you will find a section called 'Links', which lists a number of actions you can take. For example, you might want to read an article online, take a look at the code I used for the analyses, or simply download their PDF. \n\nYou may also visit the ['About'](about.html) section to learn a little more about me. There you can also download my curriculum vitae. If you have any questions, comments or requests, feel free to contact me. \n\nEnjoy your stay!\n\nI am currently busy building this site. Watch this space!\n",
