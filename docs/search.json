      "contents": "\r\nHi! My name is Asier Moneva and I am a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR) and also at the Center of Expertise Cyber Security at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. (Yes, I have two affiliations.) Asier is a Spanish name—Basque, actually—that sounds like ah-see-AIR, with a hard ‘R’ at the end. But don’t worry, I won’t be mad if you don’t pronounce it right… the first time!\r\nMy background is in Criminology, which means I am a social scientist. In particular, I research how, when, and where cybercrime occurs, focusing on the human factors involved. To do so, I rely mainly on quantitative methods and data science, and I enjoy collaborating with researchers from other disciplines as well as with practitioners and professionals. The purpose of my research is twofold: generate knowledge to better understand cybercrime, as well as find solutions to reduce its occurrence and mitigate its impact.\r\nI am committed to open science; that’s why I built this website: to provide a portal to access my research without barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
