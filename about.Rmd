Hi! My name is Asier Moneva and I am a postdoc at the [Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR)](https://nscr.nl/) and also at the [Center of Expertise Cyber Security at The Hague University of Applied Sciences](https://www.thehagueuniversity.com/research/centre-of-expertise/details/centre-of-expertise-cyber-security). (Yes, I have two affiliations.) Asier is a Spanish name---Basque, actually---that sounds like *ah-see-AIR*, with a hard 'R' at the end. But don't worry, I won't be mad if you don't pronounce it right... the first time!
  
  My background is in Criminology, which means I am a social scientist. In particular, I research *how*, *when*, and *where* cybercrime occur, focusing on the *human factors* involved. To do so, I rely mainly on quantitative methods and data science, and I enjoy collaborating with researchers from other disciplines as well as with practitioners and professionals. The purpose of my research is twofold: to generate knowledge to better understand cybercrime, and to find solutions to reduce it or mitigate its impact.
  
  I am committed to open science; that's why I built this website: to provide a portal to access my research without barriers.
